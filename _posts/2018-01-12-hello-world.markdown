This is the first post... The same old story. Hello world. Anyone there? Do you copy? Is the message loud and clear?

There isn't much of a plan for this blog, no special schedule or direction. It probably will be a bunch of random rants and 
posts about stuff that I've been up to, or wanting to be up to, or dreaming of being up too...

And in between, maybe some actual stuff I did, like some software I'm building on my spare time (GitHub link on the footer),
a tutorial about something I've learned, a new track (like the one embedded), some video I did for something (occasionally I do VJ, but not as much as before)...

Besides all that, there is also my CV and publication list from ages ago. Just to keep that stuff available online for someone interested on hiring me ;).
