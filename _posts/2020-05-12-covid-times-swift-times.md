During this lock-down I've been having plenty of free hours. I decided to do something I've been wanting to do 
for quite a while with all this time: *learn how write MacOSX apps using Swift*.

I've done a couple of applications in **Objective-C** in the past and I really like the ecosystem. 
**X-Code** is my IDE for *all-things-C-related* (**OpenFrameworks**, **C++**, **Cocoa Apps**).
Always loved to draw some User Interfaces, ever since the old times of **Interface Builder**.

Swift feels like a fresh language. It has some quirks that takes time to get used to, but after a while, they
all make sense. In a couple of weeks I was able to go from *noob* to *effective* and in no time I'll reach the
*proficient* level. Still, this is evolution isn't out of the blue, all those years of **Cocoa** and *Objective-C*
are paying out and my previous experience is valuable... It feels mostly just like swapping Obj-C for Swift...

I've started a project based on a personal need. In a couple of weeks I've implemented around 80% of the *MVP*. The basis
is all there, all that is needed are some small but crucial details.

If all goes according to plan, I'll be submitting an app to Apple's *AppStore* really soon. I'm also planing some Swift-related
content in this website... Until then, I'll keep on coding...
